# PHP Assignments

This repository contains three PHP programs designed to demonstrate basic PHP functionalities such as loops, control structures, and prime number checks. These scripts are intended to be run using PHP's Command Line Interface (CLI).

## Programs

### 1. Adding All Integers Between 0 and 50 Using a `for` Loop
This program calculates the sum of all integers from 0 to 50 using a `for` loop and displays the total.

**File:** `add_numbers.php`

### 2. Checking Voting Eligibility
This program determines if a person is eligible to vote based on their age using a control structure.

**File:** `check_voting.php`

### 3. Checking Whether a Number is Prime
This program checks whether a given number is prime and outputs the result.

**File:** `check_prime.php`

## How to Run the Programs

### Prerequisites
- PHP must be installed on your system.
- Ensure PHP is added to your system's PATH environment variable.

### Steps
1. Save each program as a `.php` file in a desired directory.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the PHP files.
4. Run each program using the following commands:

```bash
php add_numbers.php
php check_voting.php
php check_prime.php
```

### Example Outputs

#### Adding All Integers Between 0 and 50
```bash
The total of integers between 0 and 50 is: 1275
```

#### Checking Voting Eligibility
```bash
The person is eligible to vote.
```

#### Checking Whether a Number is Prime
```bash
29 is a prime number.
```

## Notes
- Modify the variables in the scripts (`$age` and `$number`) to test with different inputs.
- Ensure that your PHP version is up-to-date to avoid compatibility issues.
