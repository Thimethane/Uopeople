# HTML Forms Assignment

This project demonstrates the creation and functionality of HTML forms using GET and POST methods. The forms are designed based on the assignment instructions from the W3Schools HTML tutorial.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **form-methods/**: Contains two HTML forms:
    - `form_get.html`: A form that uses the GET method.
    - `form_post.html`: A form that uses the POST method.
  
- **form-controls/**: Contains individual HTML files for different form control tasks:
    - `marital-status.html`: A form to choose marital status.
    - `diabetes-history.html`: A form to indicate diabetes history.
    - `feedback-form.html`: A form to submit feedback for a food delivery service.
    - `favorite-sport.html`: A form to select a favorite sport.

- **screenshots/**: Contains images showing the output of the forms.

## HTML Forms Overview

### GET Method Form
- **Usage**: The GET method appends form data to the URL, making it visible in the browser's address bar.
- **Sample Form**: `form_get.html`
- **Output Screenshot**: `form_get_output.png`

### POST Method Form
- **Usage**: The POST method sends form data in the HTTP request body, keeping the data hidden.
- **Sample Form**: `form_post.html`
- **Output Screenshot**: `form_post_output.png`

## Form Control Elements
